# Embark
A jumpstart for Laravel projects.

There were some things that I did/used with new Laravel projects, so putting those things in a package speeds up that process. Maybe you'll find it useful as well. This package is in the public domain (using the [Unlicense](http://unlicense.org/)), so go ahead and use it for anything.

## This is a work in progress, not ready for production yet.
